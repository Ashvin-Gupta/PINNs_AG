# PINNs_AG

Repo for my individual Meng project titled 'Characterising the electrical properties of the human atrium using physics-informed neural networks.'

Data generation: MATLAB code to create input data to neural network using the Aliev-Panfilov model
FK model: MATLAB code to create input data to neural network using the Fenton-Karma model (more random APs)
Jupyter: Jupyter notebooks code used for debugging
PINNs: Python code for the running and set up of the physics-informed neural networks
